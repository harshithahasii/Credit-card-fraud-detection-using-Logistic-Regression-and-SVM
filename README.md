Right and wrong ways to deal with imbalance data.

If imbalanced data is not taken care, the model developed will be biased. 
The wrong ways shown in these notebook are :
  1) Upsampling before validation.
  2) Undersampling before validation.
The correct implementation is using:
  1) SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique).
  
The two different ML models used are:
  1) Logistic Regression.
  2) Support Vector Machine.
