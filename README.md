# Credit-card-fraud-detection-using-Logistic-Regression-and-SVM

The dataset used for this project is taken from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

Right and wrong ways to deal with imbalance data.

If imbalanced data is not taken care, the model developed will be biased. 
The wrong ways are :
  1) Upsampling before validation.
  2) Undersampling before validation.
The correct implementation is using:
  1) SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique).
  
The two different ML models used are:
  1) Logistic Regression.
  2) Support Vector Machine.
